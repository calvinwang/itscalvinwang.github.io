<p>My name is Calvin. I'm a UC Berkeley sophomore double majoring in computer
science and economics. I enjoy baseball, working out, maps, the New York Times
Crossword, Shanghainese cuisine, and anything related to technology or finance.
I started this website and blog to catalogue my professional experiences and
write about my various interests and thoughts, whether it's my passion for
baseball analytics, learning how to make maps, the books I'm reading, or just
my thoughts on the world around me.
